Data analysis

childcare centres or planning permit info
change report

tools to use:
requests library
create a library within a folder
import difflib


phase 1 (childcare):
- parse the 2 most recent files in a particular folder (files have identical structure)
	determine where data starts
- compare the files to identify differences
- summarise the differences by providing an output of the rows that do not completely match
- provide a reason for how each record differs between the files

phase 2:
- structure resulting changes into a form that can be integrated directly into master files

phase 3:
- extend to include other uses (woolies, coles, planning permits)


other ideas to consider:
- include a user input form
- geocode the resulting difference using Google API
- automate this process periodically
